        "\n",
        "- Manufacturing Year (year): The scatter plot of year vs. Selling_Price (Q7) likely shows a positive correlation, indicating that newer bikes tend to have higher selling prices. This is a primary driver as newer models are generally more desirable and have less wear and tear.\n",
        "- Kilometers Driven (km_driven): While not explicitly plotted against selling price, the correlation heatmap (Q9) is expected to reveal a negative correlation between km_driven and Selling_Price. Bikes with lower mileage generally command higher prices due to less usage and better condition.\n",
        "- Ownership Type (owner): The scatter plot (Q7) also visualized owner with respect to year and Selling_Price. Typically, bikes with fewer owners (e.g., 'First Owner') tend to have higher selling prices, implying better maintenance or perceived reliability. The bar plot in Q5 showed how km_driven varies by ownership type, which indirectly links to selling price.\n",
        "- Seller Type (seller_type): The bar plot of average selling price by seller_type (Q4) would have shown differences in pricing strategy or bike quality across seller categories (e.g., individual sellers vs. dealers), suggesting that the source of sale impacts the price.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering Performed:\n",
        "- Missing Value Identification (Q2): We checked for missing values across all columns to understand data completeness. Although a handling strategy was described, specific imputation or removal was not performed in the provided code cells for most missing data, except for the outlier removal step.\n",
        "- Outlier Removal for km_driven (Q6): The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was applied to the km_driven column to identify and remove outliers. This step was crucial for improving the representativeness of summary statistics and potentially model performance by reducing the impact of extreme values.\n",
        "- One-Hot Encoding for seller_type (Q8): The categorical seller_type column was converted into a numeric format using one-hot encoding. This technique creates new binary columns for each unique category, making the feature suitable for many machine learning models that require numerical input."
